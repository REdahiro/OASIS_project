# Single-cell immune cell atlas with multi-layer omics data in Japanese

## Overview
We constructed multi-omics immune cell atlas, <ins>**O**</ins>saka <ins>**A**</ins>tla<ins>**s**</ins> of <ins>**I**</ins>mmune Cell<ins>**s**</ins> (OASIS), from 235 Japanese including COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. The 5â€™ single-cell transcriptomics data profiled over 1,500,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells. OASIS links these single-cell transcriptomics data with host genetics, plasma proteomics, and metagenomics data.\
\
This repository provides code used for single-cell eQTL mapping, colocalization analysis, PRS analysis, megatenomics analysis, and single-cell deconvolution of various somatic mutations in OASIS paper.
